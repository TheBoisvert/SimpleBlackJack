A simple 1 player against computer dealer blackjack game that plays in the Terminal!

I tried to follow the rules of blackjack as much as possible.
I've taken the rules from this website : https://bicyclecards.com/how-to-play/blackjack/

This plays with a single pack of cards.
Betting limits follow general rule, minimum of 2 and maximum of 500.
The dealer's bank is infinite.
